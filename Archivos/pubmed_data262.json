        "Abstract": "The ectomycorrhizal symbionts of silver fir have rarely been analyzed and identified, so little is known about their diversity and distribution. The aim of this study was (1) to analyze the diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungal species in three geographically distinct forest stands of <i>Abies alba</i> and (2) to demonstrate the high temporal variability of the ectomycorrhizal community over two consecutive growing seasons using repeated monthly sampling. Root samples were taken every month during two growing seasons in three silver fir-dominated forest stands. The ectomycorrhizal root tips were first assigned to a morphotype based on morphological characteristics and then identified by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region. Alpha and beta diversity differed significantly between all three study sites, with the most diverse and even ectomycorrhizal community described in plot Jelovški boršt. The diversity indices over the growing season were different at two of the three study sites, supporting the idea of a fluctuation of ectomycorrhizal taxa during the growing seasons of the two consecutive years. While significant temporal variability was only confirmed for certain ectomycorrhizal taxa, there were no significant changes in the ectomycorrhizal community in general. Thus, we confirmed the high spatial but low temporal variability of the ectomycorrhizal community associated with silver fir.",

        "Title": "Genetic Differentiation of <i>Abies alba</i> Outside Its Main Range Under Warm Meso- and Sub-Mediterranean Conditions in Italy and Switzerland.",
        "Abstract": "<i>Abies alba</i> is an important European tree species currently mostly found at cool and humid sites in the montane zone. In the past, it grew under markedly warmer and drier climates during the Eemian and mid-Holocene, and cryptic Mediterranean populations confirm the species' capacity to grow under warm, summer-dry conditions. However, it is unknown if warm-loving Mediterranean occurrences are related to specific genetic properties (e.g., subspecies or ecotypes). Investigating the genetics of cryptic warm-loving populations is crucial for a better understanding of past and future population dynamics of <i>A. alba</i>. We genotyped 478 <i>A. alba</i> samples at 174 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), covering a broad latitudinal range from Southern Italy to Switzerland while accounting for local altitudinal gradients, and combined these newly introduced genotypes with those of other European <i>Abies</i> populations from the literature. Population genetic structure analyses grouped the warm-loving meso- and sub-Mediterranean populations into the same genetic cluster as the mountain populations of each region. The occurrence of three genetic clusters from Northern to Southern Italy is in line with the glacial refugia history. The inferred evolutionary and demographic history suggests a northward expansion of <i>A. alba</i> after glaciation, as well as a trans-Adriatic gene flow between Balkan and Southern Italian populations. Collectively, the combined genotypic data from individuals across the species' range demonstrate that cryptic Mediterranean populations of <i>A. alba</i> align with the local and large-scale genetic structure of populations from its main range, suggesting that the species is able to thrive in a warmer and drier environmental range than hitherto anticipated. This finding implies that it is unneeded to postulate extinct subspecies or ecotypes to explain the occurrence of meso- and sub-Mediterranean Eemian or mid-Holocene silver fir forests, with important implications for future <i>A. alba</i> population dynamics.",

        "Abstract": "Non-native trees disrupt ecological processes vital to native plant communities. We studied how forests dominated by <i>Acacia dealbata</i> and <i>Eucalyptus globulus</i> affect the role of birds as dual pollinators and seed dispersers in a region heavily impacted by these two non-native species. We compared bird-plant interactions in the native and in the two non-native forest types. We constructed a multilayer regional network for each forest type and evaluated differences in network dissimilarity between networks. We also calculated the bird's importance in connecting processes and variables associated with module diversity. To determine how the networks react to changes in species richness, we did a simulation of species richness gradient and link percentage for each forest type. The number of birds acting both as pollinators and seed dispersers was higher in native than in non-native forests. However, birds in non-native forests still play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological services provided to native plant communities. However, the eucalyptus network exhibited a concerning simplification, forcing bird species to fully exploit the few remaining resources, leaving little room for structural adjustments and limiting the ecosystem's ability to withstand further species loss. These findings highlight how non-native trees may trigger cascading effects across trophic levels.",

        "Abstract": "Natural native forests are rapidly being replaced by anthropogenic forests often with a strong presence of invasive alien plant species. Eucalypt species are widely planted worldwide, with Eucalyptus globulus plantations being particularly expressive in Portugal. Poor forestry practices often lead to the associated expansion of invasive species, such as Acacia dealbata. However, we still know relatively little about the functioning of anthropogenic forests, such as seed and pollen dispersal services. Here, we compared bird abundance and richness and the seed and pollen dispersal networks in both forest types. Anthropogenic forests presented lower bird abundance, and smaller, more simplified, and more random (abundance-based) seed dispersal services than those of natural forests. Interestingly, the pollen dispersal network was more similar than the seed dispersal network for both forest types and dominated by opportunistic and neutral processes, given the absence of specialized nectarivorous. The proportion of birds transporting seeds decreased, while those carrying pollen significantly increased in the anthropogenic forest compared to the native forest. Our work highlights the impact of anthropogenic forests on bird abundance, with consequences for seed dispersal services and forest regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "The widespread use of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCH) as pesticides has raised environmental concerns due to their persistence and toxicity. Addressing the pressing need for effective bioremediation strategies, this study explores the effects of α-, β-, δ-, and ε-HCH isomers on the growth, hormonal changes, physiological parameters and bioaccumulation in Alnus glutinosa saplings (1-year-old and 2-year-old) and bacterial communities in polluted soil. A. glutinosa saplings not only withstanded HCH exposure but also enhanced the remediation efficiency by 6.8-24.4%, suggesting an acceleration of pollutant breakdown likely mediated by root exudates positively affecting the soil microbiome. Interestingly, 1-year-old saplings demonstrated greater remediation efficiency post-pruning than unpruned 2-year-old saplings, despite the latter having a larger root biomass. The hormonal analysis indicated that HCH presence led to a reduction in abscisic acid (ABA) and an increase in jasmonic acid (JA), with the magnitude of changes being age-dependent. Salicylic acid (SA) levels increased 1-year-old and decreased in 2-year-old saplings under HCH stress. Moreover, a higher presence of lin-degrading genes in the rhizosphere of treated saplings compared to controls confirmed ongoing biodegradation processes. The outcomes help to better understand the processes involved in degradation of persistent pesticides in soil. The mechanism of in-plant isomerization and the identification of metabolites should be the focus of future research.",

        "Abstract": "The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as 'high-risk plants, plant products and other objects'. Taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by the applicant country, this Scientific Opinion covers the plant health risks posed by the following commodities: <i>Alnus cordata</i>, <i>A. glutinosa</i> and <i>A. incana</i> graftwood, bare-root plants and rooted plants in pots up to 7 years old imported into the EU from the UK. A list of pests potentially associated with the commodities was compiled. The relevance of each pest was assessed based on evidence following defined criteria. Two EU-quarantine pests (<i>Entoleuca mammata, Phytophthora ramorum</i> (non-EU isolates)) and one non-quarantine pest (<i>Phytophthora siskiyouensis</i>) were selected for further evaluation. For the selected pests, the risk mitigation measures implemented in the UK and specified in the technical dossier were evaluated taking into account the factors reducing their efficacy. For these pests, an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. The degree of pest freedom varies between the pests evaluated, with <i>E. mammata</i> being the pest most frequently expected on imported <i>Alnus</i> spp. small trees. Expert knowledge elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9927 and 10,000 per 10,000 <i>Alnus</i> spp. small trees (bare-root plants or rooted plants in pots up to 7 years old) would be free from <i>E. mammata.</i>",

        "Abstract": "Species lists are fundamental for knowledge of species diversity in regions subject to intense anthropogenic pressure, especially in poorly-studied ecosystems. The dataset comes from an inventory conducted in 30 fragments of Myrtaceae swamp forest, located in an agroforestry matrix landscape of the coastal La Araucanía Region in Chile. The data collection was carried out using line transect sampling, which was traced through the core of each fragment orientated towards its longest axis. The dataset provides a record of 55 species (24 trees, 1 vine [as a host], 16 herbs and 15 shrubs) including accidental epiphytes (n = 7), hemiparasites (n = 4), host (n = 10) and additionally woody debris (n = 36). The most frequent trees in the landscape were <i>Myrceugenia exsucca</i> (n = 36 records) and <i>Blepharocalyx cruckshanksii</i> (n = 33 records), species that were also the most common hosts. <i>Drimys winteri</i> was a companion species, other trees and shrubs generally being rarely observed, as was the case of the introduced species (<i>Prunus avium</i>, <i>Rubus constrictus</i> and <i>Ulex europaeus</i>). Branches were the most common microhabitat for hemiparasites. Within this group, <i>Lepidoceras chilense</i> was the most frequent species. For accidental epiphytes, Drimys winteri, which commonly grows on the ground (soil), were the most common species found in the main trunk crotch. Some unusual observations were the climber <i>Cissus striata</i> as host of <i>Tristerix corymbosus</i> (hemiparasite) and <i>Tristerix corymbosus</i> as host of <i>Lepidoceras chilense</i> (hemiparasite).This study represents a landscape-scale sample of the swamp forest, which is distributed in a dispersed pattern over a large stretch of Chile. The data were collected from 30 forest patches (from 0.05 to 936 ha), located on the coast of the Araucanía. The database includes the presence of 55 species of vascular plants in 356 records. The main novelty of this contribution is the systematic classification of species under six traits, never before reported in the same database: (i) condition (coarse woody debris, fallen log, live, snag), (ii) habit (herb, shrub, tree), (iii) growth microhabitat (e.g. tree trunk, branch, main trunk crotch), (iv) growth form (accidental epiphyte, hemiparasite, terricolous, vegetative), (v) host species (as appropriate) and (vi) relative location of the species in the sampled patch and surrounding areas (core, border, matrix). Species not previously observed in these forests were: <i>Gavilea</i> spp., <i>Hieracium</i> spp., <i>Lophosoria quadripinnata</i>, <i>Berberis actinacantha</i>, <i>Gaultheria phillyreifolia</i>, <i>Ovidia pillo-pillo</i>, <i>Amomyrtus meli</i> and <i>Caldcluvia paniculata</i>. In addition, two introduced species are novelties for the catalogue of vascular plants of Chile (<i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i> and <i>Prunus avium</i>). Several of these ecosystem traits are indeed new reports for these types of forests (e.g. accidental epiphytes, fallen logs, species-host relationship); at the same time, more frequent data (i.e. species composition, habit) are found in different contributions, making the comprehensive process of analysis difficult. Accordingly, the database is made available in this manuscript.",

        "Title": "Floral development of Berberidopsis beckleri - can an additional species of the Berberidopsidaceae add evidence to floral evolution in the core eudicots?",
        "Abstract": "Berberidopsis beckleri is one of three species of the family Berberidopsidaceae. The flower of Berberidopsis is unusual for core eudicots in being spiral with an undifferentiated perianth. In a previous study of the sister species B. corallina , it was suggested that Berberidopsidaceae represent a prototype for the origin of the bipartite perianth and pentamery in core eudicots.The floral development of B. beckleri was investigated with a scanning electron microscope and compared with previous studies on B. corallina and Aextoxicon punctatum of Berberidopsidales.Flowers are inserted at the end of short shoots, which are not distinguishable from a pedicel. The initiation of perianth parts is highly predictable and spiral with a divergence angle of 137·5°, in a progression of a variable number of bracts to weakly differentiated sepaloid and petaloid tepals. The androecium most often consists 11 stamens arising in a rapid sequence. Compared with B. corallina , the number of perianth parts and stamens is more variable and there is no evidence of an alternation of shorter and longer plastochrons leading to a whorled arrangement. However, the gynoecium is generally pentamerous and arises from five primordia. The carpels are laterally connected into massive intercarpellary ridges on which ovules are initiated.The position of Streptothamnus within Berberidopsidaceae is questioned. It is demonstrated that the floral development of Berberidopsis beckleri lies within a gradient from spiral flowers without perianth differentiation leading to flowers with differentiated sepals and petals. The arrangement of flowers in compact inflorescences in B. corallina and Aextoxicon leads to a more stabilized arrangement of organs in whorls. The inherent variability of the flower of Berberidopsis is well correlated with the limited canalization of flowers in taxa at the base of the core eudicots and could act as a prototype for the current eudicot floral Bauplan.",

        "Title": "Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Analyses Reveal Dark Heartwood Formation Mechanism in <i>Acacia melanoxylon</i>.",
        "Abstract": "<i>Acacia melanoxylon</i> is highly valued for its commercial applications, with the heartwood exhibiting a range of colors from dark to light among its various clones. The underlying mechanisms contributing to this color variation, however, have not been fully elucidated. In an effort to understand the factors that influence the development of dark heartwood, a comparative analysis was conducted on the microstructure, substance composition, differential gene expression, and metabolite profiles in the sapwood (SW), transition zone (TZ), and heartwood (HW) of two distinct clones, SR14 and SR25. A microscopic examination revealed that heartwood color variations are associated with an increased substance content within the ray parenchyma cells. A substance analysis indicated that the levels of starches, sugars, and lignin were more abundant in SP compared to HW, while the concentrations of phenols, flavonoids, and terpenoids were found to be higher in HW than in SP. Notably, the dark heartwood of the SR25 clone exhibited greater quantities of phenols and flavonoids compared to the SR14 clone, suggesting that these compounds are pivotal to the color distinction of the heartwood. An integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolomics data uncovered a significant accumulation of sinapyl alcohol, sinapoyl aldehyde, hesperetin, 2', 3, 4, 4', 6'-peptahydroxychalcone 4'-O-glucoside, homoeriodictyol, and (2S)-liquiritigenin in the heartwood of SR25, which correlates with the up-regulated expression of <i>CCRs</i> (<i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr3</i>.<i>1751</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr4</i>.<i>654_667</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr4</i>.<i>675</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr4</i>.<i>699</i>, and <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr4</i>.<i>704</i>), <i>COMTs</i> (<i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr13</i>.<i>3082</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr13</i>.<i>3086</i>, and <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr7</i>.<i>1411</i>), <i>CADs</i> (<i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr10</i>.<i>2175</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr1</i>.<i>3453</i>, and <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr8</i>.<i>1600</i>), and <i>HCTs</i> (<i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr4</i>.<i>1122</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr4</i>.<i>1123</i>, <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr8</i>.<i>1758</i>, and <i>evm</i>.<i>TU</i>.<i>Chr9</i>.<i>2960</i>) in the TZ of <i>A</i>. <i>melanoxylon</i>. Furthermore, a marked differential expression of transcription factors (TFs), including <i>MYBs</i>, <i>AP2/ERFs</i>, <i>bHLHs</i>, <i>bZIPs</i>, <i>C2H2s</i>, and <i>WRKYs</i>, were observed to be closely linked to the phenols and flavonoids metabolites, highlighting the potential role of multiple TFs in regulating the biosynthesis of these metabolites and, consequently, influencing the color variation in the heartwood. This study facilitates molecular breeding for the accumulation of metabolites influencing the heartwood color in <i>A</i>. <i>melanoxylon</i>, and offers new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying heartwood formation in woody plants.",

The influence of five doses of each EOs was tested against Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Phytophthora parasitica, Pythium aphanidermatum, Alternaria brassicae, Cladobotryum mycophilum and Trichoderma aggressivum f.sp. europaeum using disc-diffusion method. The mycelial growth inhibition and ED<sub>50</sub> were calculated. The chemical analysis of the EOs was analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. A total of 58 compounds were identified in the 12 EOs. All essential oils (EOs) analysed showed antifungal activity against the test pathogens in the range of 5·32-100%. The inhibitory effect of oils showed dose-dependent activity on the tested fungus. Based on the ED<sub>50</sub> values, clove, rose geranium, peppermint and patchouli were the most effective. This study warrants further research into the practical use of EOs for the control of important myco- and phytopathogens in intensive horticulture.Due to the serious damage caused by fungal pathogens of vegetables and mushrooms, it is necessary to search for integrated strategies of disease control. This study provides relevant information about the effects of 12 essential oils (EOs) against eight pathogens of agricultural interest, included mycopathogens with emphasis on the possible future application of the EOs as alternative antifungal agents.",

Four hundred and eighty nine samples were collected by swabbing all trees which had hollows or fissures in the seven parks studied. Each tree was sampled once during the study period and one or more isolates were recovered from each swab. Eight isolates of C. neoformans and 18 isolates of C. gattii were recovered from 15 out of 489 tree samples. C. neoformans was isolated from Tipuana tipu, Eucalyptus spp., and Phoenix sp. All isolates were serotype A and belonged to genotype VNI. C. gattii was isolated from Tipuana tipu, Cedrus deodara, Eucalyptus spp., Acacia visca, Cupresus sempervirens and Ulmus campestrus. All isolates were serotype B and genotype VGI, like both C. gattii strains isolated in 2001. On two occasions, both species were isolated from the same tree sample. These results reinforce and extend our previous findings especially about the presence of C. gattii serotype B, genotype VGI, in Argentina.",

        "Abstract": "The biodiversity hotspot of central Chile is home to a high proportion of endemic species, but some of these species are inconspicuous and not easily observed. During a botanical exploration in the Los Queules National Reserve (Chile), a population of <i>Aspleniumtrilobum</i> Cav. was identified. The plants were found growing on the bark of a <i>Myrceugeniaparvifolia</i> (DC.) Kausel tree in a small swamp next to specimens of <i>Drimyswinteri</i> J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. (35°59'11.84\"S; 72°41'11.53\"W). Several previously unrecorded species were found, including Carexcf.excelsa Poepp. ex Kunth, <i>Chusquea</i> cf. <i>quila Kunth</i>, Ercillacf.spicata (Bertero) Moq., and <i>Boquilatrifoliolata</i> (DC.) Decne., highlighting the importance of exploring and documenting this biodiversity hotspot. The discovery in this wilderness area extends the distribution 86 km north on the continent, which was previously limited to the east of the municipality of Penco in the Biobío region (36°44'9.26\"S; 72°57'42.5\"W). This paper presents an observed specimen, its locality, and associated species.",

        "Abstract": "Host plants are used by herbivorous insects as feeding or nesting resources. In wood-boring insects, host plants features may impose selective forces leading to phenotypic differentiation on traits related to nest construction. Carpenter bees build their nests in dead stems or dry twigs of shrubs and trees; thus, mandibles are essential for the nesting process, and the nest is required for egg laying and offspring survival. We explored the shape and intensity of natural selection on phenotypic variation on three size measures of the bees (intertegular width, wing length, and mandible area) and two nest architecture measures (tunnel length and diameter) on bees using the native species Chusquea quila (Poaceae), and the alloctonous species Rubus ulmifolius (Rosaceae), in central Chile. Our results showed significant and positive linear selection gradients for tunnel length on both hosts, indicating that bees building long nests have more offspring. Bees with broader mandibles show greater fitness on C. quila but not on R. ulmifolius. Considering that C. quila represents a selective force on mandible area, we hypothesized a high adaptive value of this trait, resulting in higher fitness values when nesting on this host, despite its wood is denser and hence more difficult to be bored.",

A 36 male albino mice of six equal sets were used in the study each with 6 mice; Control, cupressuflavone (200 mg/kg), and <i>Cupressus sempervirens</i> (<i>C. sempervirens</i>) (80 mg/kg), <i>S. mansoni</i> <b>-</b>infected mice, cupressuflavone (200 mg/kg) <b>+</b> <i>S. mansoni</i> <b>-</b>infected mice, and <i>C. sempervirens</i> (80 mg/kg) <b>+</b> <i>S. mansoni</i> <b>-</b>infected mice for 4 weeks. Serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and Sex hormone binding globulin were determined. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, total protein, and cholesterol in testis were detected. Antioxidants and sodium/potassium-ATPase in the hypothalamus, testis, and sperm were identified. Sperm counts, motility, and abnormality, as well as, sperm monoclonal proliferating antibody Ki-67 were evaluated. The results revealed that <i>S. mansoni</i> decreased superoxide dismutase, glutathione, serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sperm count and motility, sodium/potassium-ATPase activity while increased malondialdehyde, serum follicle stimulating hormone, sex hormone binding globulin, and luteinizing hormone, glucose-6-phosphatedehydrogenase, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, cholesterol, total protein, sperm abnormality, the percentage of spermatogonia, 1st spermatocyte, 2nd spermatocyte, and spermatid in the testis. Also, <i>C. sempervirens</i> and cupressuflavone oral administration to <i>S. mansoni</i>-infected group back all of the aforementioned parameters to be close control values where <i>C. sempervirens</i> had an efficient impact than cupressuflavone did. In conclusion, <i>C. sempervirens</i> sustains testosterone cycle and sperm quality in <i>S. mansonii</i>-related testicular dysfunction.",

        "Abstract": "Cymbopogon martini, Syzygium aromaticum, and Cupressus sempervirens are used for antimicrobial purposes in the worldwide. Both their extracts and essential oil contents are rich in active ingredients.The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Cymbopogon martini essential oil (CMEO), Syzygium aromaticum essential oil (SAEO) and Cupressus sempervirens essential oil (CSEO) on Candida albicans biofilm formation on heat-polymerized polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) samples in vitro and in silico.Essential oil contents with anticandidal potential were determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. Following C. albicans adhesion, PMMA samples were treated independently with Corega<sup>®</sup> and each essential oil. The anticandidal activity of the essential oils was determined by spectrophotometric absorbance measurement at 600 nm, taking into account the cultures of each sample. The cytotoxicity evaluation of essential oils was performed by MTT Colorimetric assay. The software package AutoDockTools (1.5.6) was used for the in silico studies. The effect of essential oil content on the inhibition of Secreted aspartic proteinase (SAP2) was evaluated considering the Ligand@SAP2 complex formation.2% of CMEO and 5% of SAEO exhibited higher anticandidal activity than Corega<sup>®</sup> (p < 0.05), whereas Corega<sup>®</sup> had higher anticandidal activity than 2% and 5% of CSEO (p < 0.05). The cytotoxicity of essential oils on NIH/3T3 cells after 24 h was found to be 2.41 for CSEO, 2.84 for CMEO, and 2.85 µg/mL for SAEO. The results of the in silico study showed that citronellol from CMEO, chavibetol (m-eugenol) from SAEO and β-pinene from CSEO each had the highest effect on the inhibition of SAP2. The highest binding affinity value was found for citronellol at -5.3 kcal/mol.The biofilm formation of C. albicans onto acrylic resin was inhibited by CMEO, SAEO and CSEO at a concentration of 2% through in vitro assay. The most effective inhibition was determined to be due to citronellol in CMEO through in silico analysis.",

        "Abstract": "Floristic composition, population structure, and regeneration status of woody species of Dabal forest found in East Hararghe zone of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia, were studied. Vegetation data were obtained from 52 main plots of 20 × 20 m for mature woody species and 5 subplots of 5 × 5 m for seedlings and saplings. Density and dbh of each live woody plant species found in each sample plot were recorded. Frequency, basal area, importance value, and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were also computed. Totally 59 woody plant species distributed in 33 families were documented. Of these, 45.80, 44.10, and 5.08% were shrubs, trees, and lianas, respectively. Species diversity and evenness indices were 3.56 and 0.87, respectively. Stem count of all woody species was 3379 stems ha<sup>-1</sup>. Out of this, 44.6, 30.8, and 24.59% were seedlings (dbh <3.5 cm), saplings (dbh between 3.5 and 10 cm), and mature (dbh >10 cm) individuals, respectively.

Most of these species were top densest, dominant, and frequent. Analysis of population structure based on pooled densities of all species in each dbh class showed that density of seedling > sapling > mature individuals, signifying healthy population structure with good natural regeneration potential. On individual basis, however, 35.6 and 8.5% of species showed fair and poor regeneration statuses, respectively, that deserve attention for conservation.",

        "Abstract": "One-sided surface charring of wood is a modification process used to lower moisture absorption and improve the resistance to biological degradation for durable surface exterior claddings. <i>Cupressus lusitanica</i>, <i>Gmelina arborea,</i> and <i>Tectona grandis</i> wood samples from fast-growth plantation were charred with a hot plate using three temperatures (300, 350, and 400 °C ± 3 °C) for 10 min. Wood density, surface quality (color and presence of splits), and sorption characteristics (wetting rate and water uptake) were evaluated. Results show that samples charred at 300 °C presented a lower loss of density and thickness than samples charred at 400 °C. Changes in the chemical structure of the wood as a result of the high temperatures caused a decrease of all color parameters (L*, a*, and b*). These values decreased in the samples charred at 400 °C for the three species. Also, the presence of cracks and splits on the surface, or in some cases the presence of detachments from the charring surface, was mostly observed in the samples charred at 350 and 400 °C. One-sided surface charring reduced the liquid water sorption of wood samples in comparison with that of reference samples, especially for <i>C. lusitanica</i> and <i>T. grandis</i>. <i>G. arborea</i>, due to the composition of its anatomical structure and its initial density, chars faster than the other species, causing a greater loss of density, wetting rate values like those of the reference wood, and higher values of water uptake.",

        "Abstract": "HIV late presentation (LP) has been increasing in recent years in Europe. Our aim was to investigate the characteristics of LP in Greece using in addition to the traditional definition for LP, the time interval between HIV infection and diagnosis.Our nationwide sample included HIV-1 sequences generated from 6166 people living with HIV (PLWH) in Greece during the period 1999-2015. Our analysis was based on the molecularly inferred HIV-1 infection dates for PLWH infected within local molecular transmission clusters of subtypes A1 and B.Analysis of the determinants of LP was conducted using either CD4 counts or AIDS-defining condition at diagnosis or the time from infection to diagnosis. Older age, heterosexual transmission risk group and more recent diagnosis were associated with increased risk for LP. In contrast to previous studies, people who inject drugs (PWID) had a shorter median time to diagnosis (0.63 years) compared to men who have sex with men (MSM) (1.72 years) and heterosexuals (2.43 years). Using HIV infection dates that provide an unbiased marker for LP compared to CD4 counts at diagnosis, which are age-dependent, we estimated that the time to diagnosis increased gradually with age. Migrants infected regionally do not differ with respect to LP status compared to native Greeks.We demonstrate that older people and heterosexuals are among those at higher risk for LP; and given the growing number of older people among newly diagnosed cases, tailored interventions are needed in these populations.",

        "Abstract": "Our aim was to estimate the date of the origin and the transmission rates of the major local clusters of subtypes A1 and B in Greece. Phylodynamic analyses were conducted in 14 subtype A1 and 31 subtype B clusters. The earliest dates of origin for subtypes A1 and B were in 1982.6 and in 1985.5, respectively. The transmission rate for the subtype A1 clusters ranged between 7.54 and 39.61 infections/100 person years (IQR: 9.39, 15.88), and for subtype B clusters between 4.42 and 36.44 infections/100 person years (IQR: 7.38, 15.04). Statistical analysis revealed that the average difference in the transmission rate between the PWID and the MSM clusters was 6.73 (95% CI: 0.86 to 12.60; <i>p</i> = 0.026). Our study provides evidence that the date of introduction of subtype A1 in Greece was the earliest in Europe. Transmission rates were significantly higher for PWID than MSM clusters due to the conditions that gave rise to an extensive PWID HIV-1 outbreak ten years ago in Athens, Greece. Transmission rate can be considered as a valuable measure for public health since it provides a proxy of the rate of epidemic growth within a cluster and, therefore, it can be useful for targeted HIV prevention programs.",

        "Abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The synergistic activity of compounds in herbal drugs has been well established by multiple scientific studies. The compounds present in plants may have increased toxicity and increased efficacy. Owing to the notion that traditional medicines do not have any adverse effects, these are used heftily. <b>Aim:</b> The present study was designed to assess the toxicity of an herbal drug consisting of <i>Asparagus racemosus</i> roots, <i>Tinospora cordifolia</i> stems, and <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i> seeds extract blend (ATTEB), which is widely employed as an antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulator, adaptogen, female tonic, galactagogue, etc. <b>Methodology:</b> The current study evaluated its safety by acute (OECD 423) and subacute (OECD 407) repeated-dose toxicity studies. A phytochemical investigation was carried out and revealed the presence of principal bioactive constituents. A genotoxicity study was performed by micronucleus assay. Gross necroscopy of the animals was performed, and behavioral, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological studies were performed. <b>Results:</b> In the acute toxicity study, there was no mortality and no significant changes in behavior, organ structure, or organ weight, as observed by gross necroscopy of the animals, at a single dose of 2000 mg/kg BW. In a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study, up to a daily dose of 1000 mg/kg BW, there was no evidence of toxicity. No significant genotoxicity was observed in the mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> The LD<sub>50</sub> found to be greater than 2000 mg/kg BW with NOAEL at 1000 mg/kg BW in mice. It was found to be free from any genotoxicity. The herbal drug was found to be safe to level of category 4 and can be used further for clinical studies.",

        "Abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant public health concern, especially for low-and middle-income countries. This study explores the dual potential of medicinal plant extracts as both anticancer agents and immunomodulators, particularly in HPV-positive cervical cancer, while also addressing the limitations of conventional chemotherapy.Extracts from Tinospora cordifolia, Boerhaavia diffusa, Berberis aristata, and Ocimum basilicum were tested on CaSki and HEK 293 cells alongside cisplatin. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, cell migration, HPV DNA inhibition, IFNG secretion, and cell cycle modulation were assessed using established biochemical and immunological assays, including qPCR, ELISA, and flow cytometry.Among the extracts, B. aristata demonstrated the strongest anticancer effects on cancer cells while exhibiting minimal impact on normal cells, highlighting its therapeutic potential. It also significantly reduced cell migration and has synergistic affect with cisplatin. B. diffusa emerged as the most effective in inhibiting HPV 16 DNA, suggesting its role in viral suppression. Immunomodulatory analysis revealed that T. cordifolia and O. basilicum significantly enhanced IFNG secretion, indicative of robust immune activation. Each tested extracts induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, with T. cordifolia showing the most pronounced effect.This study highlights the novel therapeutic promise of integrating plant extracts into HPV-positive cervical cancer management. B. aristata stands out for its cytotoxicity and anti-migration properties, while T. cordifolia offers significant immunomodulatory benefits. These findings pave the way for further research into combining natural products with conventional therapies for safer, more effective cancer treatments.",

        "Abstract": "The plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i> has significantly damaged the floristic diversity and community structure of the jarrah (<i>Eucalyptus marginata</i>) forest in Western Australia. Complete eradication of the pathogen from infested sites is not possible. This study assessed the feasibility of rehabilitating <i>P. cinnamomi</i>-infested forest sites with native resistant species using various methods of seed deployment. Precision burial of seeds at 5 mm was used as a control, mimicking optimum recruitment depths for many native species and compared against the use of extruded pellets (hereafter 'pellets') as an alternative method of precision seed placement. Eighteen rehabilitation plots were set up in three <i>P. cinnamomi</i>-infested reserves using six species. For <i>Acacia acuminata</i>, <i>A. saligna</i>, <i>Calothamnus sanguineus</i> and <i>Melaleuca seriata</i>, there were three treatments: precision buried (non-pelleted) seeds, pellets and pellets with an additive (i.e., a rhizobium bacterium for the <i>Acacia</i> spp. and ectomycorrhizal fungus spores for <i>C. sanguineus</i> and <i>M. seriata</i>). <i>Banksia sessilis</i> and <i>Hakea laurina</i> had only two treatments: precision buried (non-pelleted) seeds and pellets. Seedlings of all six species emerged successfully in <i>P. cinnamomi</i>-infested sites, and the numbers ranged between 23% and 88%. The survival of emerged seedlings after 9 months ranged between 16% and 84%, except <i>M. seriata</i>, which emerged at 59% but failed to survive. In most species, except <i>A. acuminata</i>, seedling emergence and survival from pellets were similar and within an acceptable seedling establishment range when compared to non-pelleted seeds. Pelletised seed with the addition of beneficial microbes did not improve seedling survival or shoot growth in the diseased areas of the jarrah forest. Overall, the results suggest that seedlings of resistant native species can successfully establish in <i>P. cinnamomi</i>-infested sites and pelletised seeds can be used as a viable method for precision planting.",

        "Abstract": "WRKY transcription factors are essential for plant growth, health, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress.In this study, we performed a deep <i>in silico</i> characterization of the WRKY gene family in the genome of <i>Eucalyptus grandis</i>. We also analyzed the expression profiles of these genes upon colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) <i>Rhizophagus irregularis</i> (<i>Ri</i>) and infection with the bacterial pathogen <i>Ralstonia solanacearum</i> (<i>Rs</i>).A total of 117 <i>EgWRKYs</i> were identified. Phylogenetic analysis divided the EgWRKY proteins into three groups: group I (21 proteins, 17.95%), group II (65 proteins, 55.56%), and group III (24 proteins, 20.51%). Additionally, seven EgWRKY proteins (5.98%) were categorized into group IV due to the absence of the WRKY domain or zinc-finger structure. All <i>EgWRKY</i> genes are distributed irregularly across the 11 chromosomes, with 25 pairs identified as segmental duplicates and four as tandem duplicates. The promoter regions of 50% of members of each subfamily contain plant hormone-related cis-elements associated with defense responses, such as ABREs, TGACG motifs, and CGTCA motifs. All subfamilies (except for group IV-b and IV-c) contain AW-boxes, which are related to mycorrhizal induction. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that 21 <i>EgWRKYs</i> were responsive to the AMF <i>Ri</i>, with 13 and 8 genes strongly up- and downregulated, respectively. Several genes (including <i>EgWRKY116, EgWRKY62</i>, and <i>EgWRKY107</i>) were significantly induced by <i>Ri</i>; these genes might enhance the defense of <i>E. grandis</i> against <i>Rs</i>.Therefore, we identified <i>E. grandis</i> WRKY genes that are regulated by AMF colonization, some of which might improve the defense of <i>E. grandis</i> against <i>R. solanacearum</i>. These findings provide insights into <i>E. grandis</i> WRKY genes involved in interactions among the host plant, AMFs, and <i>R. solanacearum</i>.",

        "Abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the facilitation effects of an aluminum (Al) hyperaccumulator species bearing cluster roots, <i>Gevuina avellana</i>, on the seedling growth and performance of an Al-intolerant and phosphorus (P)-deficient-sensitive plant, <i>Vaccinium corymbosum</i>. For this, seedlings of <i>G. avellana</i> and <i>V. corymbosum</i> were grown alone or together as follows: i) two <i>G. avellana</i> seedlings, ii) one <i>G. avellana</i> + one <i>V. corymbosum</i> and iii) two <i>V. corymbosum</i>, in soil supplemented with Al (as Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) and in the control (without Al supplementation). We determined relative growth rate (RGR), photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll concentration, lipid peroxidation and Al and nutrient concentration [Nitrogen (N), P, potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and sulfur (S)] in leaves and roots of both species. The results showed that, in general, <i>G. avellana</i> did not assist <i>V. corymbosum</i> to enhance its RGR nor reduce its Al uptake. However, <i>G. avellana</i> assisted <i>V. corymbosum</i> in enhanced N acquisition and, consequently, to increase its chlorophyll concentration and photosynthetic rate. Besides, <i>V. corymbosum</i> had lower lipid peroxidation in leaves when grown in the soil with high Al supplementation in association with <i>G. avellana.</i> Our results suggest a facilitating effect of <i>G. avellana</i> to <i>V. corymbosum</i> when grown in soils with high Al concentration, by enhancing chlorophyll concentrations and photosynthetic rate, and decreasing the oxidative damage to lipids.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate and describe the functional differences of cultivable bacteria and fungi inhabiting the leaves of Gevuina avellana Mol. (Proteaceae) in an urban area with high levels of air pollution and in a native forest in the southern Andes.Phyllosphere microorganisms were isolated from the leaves of G. avellana, their plant growth-promoting capabilities were estimated along with their biocontrol potential and tolerance to metal(loid)s. Notably, plants from the urban area showed contrasting culturable leaf-associated microorganisms compared to those from the native area. The tolerance to metal(loid)s in bacteria range from 15 to 450 mg l-1 of metal(loid)s, while fungal strains showed tolerance from 15 to 625 mg l-1, being especially higher in the isolates from the urban area. Notably, the bacterial strain Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens and the fungal strain Cladosporium sp. exhibited several plant-growth-promoting properties along with the ability to inhibit the growth of phytopathogenic fungi.Overall, our study provides evidence that culturable taxa in G. avellana leaves is directly influenced by the sampling area. This change is likely due to the presence of atmospheric pollutants and diverse microbial symbionts that can be horizontally acquired from the environment.",

        "Title": "Ecophysiological Performance of Proteaceae Species From Southern South America Growing on Substrates Derived From Young Volcanic Materials.",
        "Abstract": "Southern South American Proteaceae thrive on young volcanic substrates, which are extremely low in plant-available phosphorus (P). Most Proteaceae exhibit a nutrient-acquisition strategy based on the release of carboxylates from specialized roots, named cluster roots (CR). Some Proteaceae colonize young volcanic substrates which has been related to CR functioning. However, physiological functioning of other Proteaceae on recent volcanic substrates is unknown. We conducted an experiment with seedlings of five Proteaceae (<i>Gevuina avellana</i>, <i>Embothrium coccineum</i>, <i>Lomatia hirsuta</i>, <i>L. ferruginea</i>, and <i>L. dentata</i>) grown in three volcanic materials. Two of them are substrates with very low nutrient concentrations, collected from the most recent deposits of the volcanoes Choshuenco and Calbuco (Chile). The other volcanic material corresponds to a developed soil that exhibits a high nutrient availability. We assessed morphological responses (i.e., height, biomass, and CR formation), seed and leaf macronutrient and micronutrient concentrations and carboxylates exuded by roots. The results show that <i>G. avellana</i> was less affected by nutrient availability of the volcanic substrate, probably because it had a greater nutrient content in its seeds and produced large CR exuding carboxylates that supported their initial growth. <i>Embothrium coccineum</i> exhibited greater total plant height and leaf P concentration than <i>Lomatia</i> species. In general, in all species leaf macronutrient concentrations were reduced on nutrient-poor volcanic substrates, while leaf micronutrient concentrations were highly variable depending on species and volcanic material. We conclude that Proteaceae from temperate rainforests differ in their capacity to grow and acquire nutrients from young and nutrient-poor volcanic substrates. The greater seed nutrient content, low nutrient requirements (only for <i>G. avellana</i>) and ability to mobilize nutrients help explain why <i>G. avellana</i> and <i>E. coccineum</i> are better colonizers of recent volcanic substrates than <i>Lomatia</i> species.",

        "Title": "Nutrient Use Efficiency of Southern South America Proteaceae Species. Are there General Patterns in the Proteaceae Family?",
        "Abstract": "Plants from the Proteaceae family can thrive in old, impoverished soil with extremely low phosphorus (P) content, such as those typically found in South Western Australia (SWA) and South Africa. The South Western (SW) Australian Proteaceae species have developed strategies to deal with P scarcity, such as the high capacity to re-mobilize P from senescent to young leaves and the efficient use of P for carbon fixation. In Southern South America, six Proteaceae species grow in younger soils than those of SWA, with a wide variety of climatic and edaphic conditions. However, strategies in the nutrient use efficiency of Southern South (SS) American Proteaceae species growing in their natural ecosystems remain widely unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate nutrient resorption efficiency and the photosynthetic nutrients use efficiency by SS American Proteaceae species, naturally growing in different sites along a very extensive latitudinal gradient. Mature and senescent leaves of the six SS American Proteaceae species (<i>Embothrium coccineum, Gevuina avellana, Orites myrtoidea Lomatia hirsuta, L. ferruginea</i>, and <i>L. dentata</i>), as well as, soil samples were collected in nine sites from southern Chile and were subjected to chemical analyses. Nutrient resorption (P and nitrogen) efficiency in leaves was estimated in all species inhabiting the nine sites evaluated, whereas, the photosynthetic P use efficiency (PPUE) and photosynthetic nitrogen (N) use efficiency (PNUE) per leaf unit were determined in two sites with contrasting nutrient availability. Our study exhibit for the first time a data set related to nutrient use efficiency in the leaves of the six SS American Proteaceae, revealing that for all species and sites, P and N resorption efficiencies were on average 47.7 and 50.6%, respectively. No correlation was found between leaf nutrient (P and N) resorption efficiency and soil attributes. Further, different responses in PPUE and PNUE were found among species and, contrary to our expectations, a higher nutrient use efficiency in the nutrient poorest soil was not found. We conclude that SS American Proteaceae species did not show a general pattern in the nutrient use efficiency among them neither with others Proteaceae species reported in the literature.",

        "Abstract": "Colleters are secretory structures characteristic of the apices of more than 60 botanical families. In the Myrtaceae, three types of colleters were previously described: petaloid, conical, and euriform. In Argentina, most species of the Myrtaceae family grow in subtropical regions and a few in the temperate-cold zones of Patagonia. We evaluated the vegetative buds of five species of the subfamily Myrtoideae, tribe Myrtea: Amomyrtus luma, Luma apiculata, and Myrceugenia exsucca, native to the temperate rainforests of Patagonia and Myrcianthes pungens and Eugenia moraviana from the riparian forest of northwestern Corrientes, in order to analyze the presence and morphological types and main secretion products of colleters. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to identify the presence of colleters in vegetative organs. Histochemical tests were performed to identify the main secretion products in these structures. The colleters are on the inner side of the leaf primordia and cataphylls and on the edge of the petiole, where they replace the stipules. They are classified as homogeneous because they consist of epidermis and internal parenchyma, both formed by cells with similar characteristics. They lack vascularization and originate from the protodermis. The colleters are of the conical type in L. apiculata, M. pungens, and E. moraviana and of the euriform type in A. luma and M. exsucca, the latter being identified by its dorsiventrally flattened shape. Histochemical tests showed the presence of lipids, mucilage, phenolic compounds, and proteins. This is the first time that colleters have been described in the analyzed species; the taxonomical and phylogenetic importance of this structures is discussed in relation to the Myrtaceae family.",

        "Abstract": "Species lists are fundamental for knowledge of species diversity in regions subject to intense anthropogenic pressure, especially in poorly-studied ecosystems. The dataset comes from an inventory conducted in 30 fragments of Myrtaceae swamp forest, located in an agroforestry matrix landscape of the coastal La Araucanía Region in Chile. The data collection was carried out using line transect sampling, which was traced through the core of each fragment orientated towards its longest axis. The dataset provides a record of 55 species (24 trees, 1 vine [as a host], 16 herbs and 15 shrubs) including accidental epiphytes (n = 7), hemiparasites (n = 4), host (n = 10) and additionally woody debris (n = 36). The most frequent trees in the landscape were <i>Myrceugenia exsucca</i> (n = 36 records) and <i>Blepharocalyx cruckshanksii</i> (n = 33 records), species that were also the most common hosts. <i>Drimys winteri</i> was a companion species, other trees and shrubs generally being rarely observed, as was the case of the introduced species (<i>Prunus avium</i>, <i>Rubus constrictus</i> and <i>Ulex europaeus</i>). Branches were the most common microhabitat for hemiparasites. Within this group, <i>Lepidoceras chilense</i> was the most frequent species. For accidental epiphytes, Drimys winteri, which commonly grows on the ground (soil), were the most common species found in the main trunk crotch. Some unusual observations were the climber <i>Cissus striata</i> as host of <i>Tristerix corymbosus</i> (hemiparasite) and <i>Tristerix corymbosus</i> as host of <i>Lepidoceras chilense</i> (hemiparasite).This study represents a landscape-scale sample of the swamp forest, which is distributed in a dispersed pattern over a large stretch of Chile. The data were collected from 30 forest patches (from 0.05 to 936 ha), located on the coast of the Araucanía. The database includes the presence of 55 species of vascular plants in 356 records. The main novelty of this contribution is the systematic classification of species under six traits, never before reported in the same database: (i) condition (coarse woody debris, fallen log, live, snag), (ii) habit (herb, shrub, tree), (iii) growth microhabitat (e.g. tree trunk, branch, main trunk crotch), (iv) growth form (accidental epiphyte, hemiparasite, terricolous, vegetative), (v) host species (as appropriate) and (vi) relative location of the species in the sampled patch and surrounding areas (core, border, matrix). Species not previously observed in these forests were: <i>Gavilea</i> spp., <i>Hieracium</i> spp., <i>Lophosoria quadripinnata</i>, <i>Berberis actinacantha</i>, <i>Gaultheria phillyreifolia</i>, <i>Ovidia pillo-pillo</i>, <i>Amomyrtus meli</i> and <i>Caldcluvia paniculata</i>. In addition, two introduced species are novelties for the catalogue of vascular plants of Chile (<i>Cupressus macrocarpa</i> and <i>Prunus avium</i>). Several of these ecosystem traits are indeed new reports for these types of forests (e.g. accidental epiphytes, fallen logs, species-host relationship); at the same time, more frequent data (i.e. species composition, habit) are found in different contributions, making the comprehensive process of analysis difficult. Accordingly, the database is made available in this manuscript.",

        "Abstract": "The role of a plant root system in resource acquisition is relevant to confront drought events caused by climate change. Accordingly, nursery practices like phosphorous (P) fertilization and root pruning have been shown to modify root architecture; however, their combined benefits require further investigation in Mediterranean species. We evaluated the effect of applied P concentrations (0, 15, 60, and 120 mg L<sup>-1</sup> P) with or without chemical (copper) root pruning (WCu, WoCu, respectively) in <i>Aristotelia chilensis</i> and <i>Quillaja saponaria</i> on morpho-physiological and root architecture traits. Higher P concentration increased nutrient content in both species concurrent with higher growth. In <i>A. chilensis</i>, higher P concentrations only increased the length and volume of medium roots. In <i>Q. saponaria</i>, P additions increased root length and diameter and the length and volume of fine and medium roots. The root-to-shoot ratio declined with WCu in <i>A. chilensis</i> (23.1%) and <i>Q. saponaria</i> (15.7%). Unlike our hypothesis, fine root architecture remained unaffected with root pruning in <i>A. chilensis</i>, while fine root length and volume decreased with increasing P concentrations in <i>Q. saponaria</i>. Thus, P fertilization enhances root development more consistently than root pruning, highlighting the need for further testing under water deficit conditions to optimize nursery practices.",

        "Abstract": "A new antioxidant lipid (AL) was synthesized from rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) belly oil and cold-pressed maqui (CPM) (<i>Aristotelia chilensis</i> (Mol.) Stuntz) seed oil via enzymatic interesterification using <i>Thermomyces lanuginosus</i> in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> medium. A Box-Behnken design with 15 experiments was employed, with the independent variables being the following: belly oil/CPM oil ratio (10/90, 50/50, and 90/10, <i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> temperature (40.0, 50.0, and 60.0 °C), and supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> pressure (100.0, 200.0, and 300.0 bar) for enzymatic interesterification. A multiple optimization was conducted based on the response variables yield and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and tocopherol contents. The optimized conditions for the AL synthesis were: 81.4/18.6 (<i>w</i>/<i>w</i>), 40.0 °C and 299.99 bar, respectively. The corresponding responses variables were: 77.10% for yield, 5.12 and 4.95 g·100 g<sup>-1</sup> total fatty acids for EPA and DHA, respectively, and 217.96, 4.28, 3.48, 64.48, and 6.39 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> oil for α-tocopherol, α-tocotrienol, β-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and δ-tocopherol, respectively. A novel AL was successfully synthesized starting from two abundant natural resources commonly considered as by-products during industrial processing. In agreement with the high EPA, DHA, and tocopherol presence, this AL can be recommended to be employed in nutritional and therapeutic supplements, according to its health benefits, particularly concerning antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.",

These species are described here as <i>Starmerella gilliamiae</i> f.a, sp. nov. (CBS 16166<sup>T</sup>; Mycobank MB 851206) and <i>Starmerella monicapupoae</i> f.a., sp. nov. (PYCC 8997<sup>T</sup>; Mycobank MB 851207). The results of a phylogenomic analysis using 1037 single-copy orthogroups indicated that <i>S. gilliamiae</i> is a member of a subclade that contains <i>Starmerella opuntiae</i>, <i>Starmerella aceti</i> and <i>Starmerella apicola</i>. The results also indicated that <i>S. monicapupoae</i> is phylogenetically related to <i>Starmerella riodocensis</i>. The two isolates of <i>S. monicapupoae</i> were obtained from flowers in Brazil and were probably vectored by insects that visit these substrates. <i>Starmerella gilliamiae</i> has a wide geographical distribution having been isolated in flowers from Brazil and Chile, fruit from Argentina and a bumblebee from Canada.",

        "Abstract": "Unique combinations of geographic and environmental conditions make quantifying the importance of factors that influence forest productivity difficult. I aimed to model the height growth of dominant Nothofagus alpina trees in temperate forests of Chile, as a proxy for forest productivity, by building a dynamic model that accounts for topography, habitat type, and climate conditions. Using stem analysis data of 169 dominant trees sampled throughout south-central Chile (35°50' and 41°30' S), I estimated growth model parameters using a nonlinear mixed-effects framework that takes into account the hierarchical structure of the data. Based on the proposed model, I used a system-dynamics approach to analyze growth rates as a function of topographic, habitat type, and climatic variability. I found that the interaction between aspect, slope, and elevation, as well as the effect of habitat type, play an essential role in determining tree height growth rates of N. alpina. Furthermore, the precipitation in the warmest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and annual mean temperature are critical climatic drivers of forest productivity. Given a forecasted climate condition for the region by 2100, where precipitation seasonality and mean annual temperature increase by 10% and 1°C, respectively, and precipitation in the warmest quarter decreases by 10 mm, I predict a reduction of 1.4 m in height growth of 100-yr-old dominant trees. This study shows that the sensitivity of N. alpina-dominated forests to precipitation and temperature patterns could lead to a reduction of tree height growth rates as a result of climate change, suggesting a decrease in carbon sequestration too. By implementing a system dynamics approach, I provide a new perspective on climate-productivity relationships, bettering the quantitative understanding of forest ecosystem dynamics under climate change. The results highlight that while temperature rising might favor forest growth, the decreasing in both amount and distribution within a year of precipitation can be even more critical to reduce forest productivity.",

        "Abstract": "Glacial periods have been considered as inhospitable environments that consist of treeless vegetation at higher latitudes. The fossil record suggests many species survived the Last Glacial Maximum within refugia, usually at lower latitudes. However, phylogeographic studies have given support to the existence of previously unknown high-latitude refugia that were not detected in the fossil record. Here, we test the hypothesis that cold-tolerant trees of Patagonia survived cold periods in microclimatically favourable locales where hybridization occurred between sister taxa. To study local presence through glacial periods in multiple refugia, we used pollen records and genetic information (isozymes, microsatellites, and combined nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences) of population pairs of Nothofagus antarctica and N. pumilio that belong to the ancient subgenus Nothofagus which can potentially hybridize in nature, along their entire latitudinal range in Patagonia. Studied species share the N. dombeyi type pollen, which was abundant at >20% in the northernmost latitudinal bands (35-43°S), even during the Last Glacial Maximum. Mid- and southern latitudinal records (44-55°S) yielded lower abundances of ~10% that increased after c. 15.0 cal. ka BP. Therefore, fossil pollen evidence suggests a long-lasting local presence of Nothofagus throughout glacial-interglacial cycles but mostly as small populations between 44°S and 51°S. We found species-specific and shared genetic variants, the latter of which attained relatively high frequencies, thus providing evidence of ancestral polymorphisms. Populations of each species were similarly diverse, suggesting survival throughout the latitudinal range. Estimates of coalescent divergence times were broadly synchronous across latitudes, suggesting that regional climates similarly affected populations and species that hybridized through climate cycles, fostering local persistence.",

        "Abstract": "Knowledge on mesoclimatic zonation and microclimatic variations within mountain forest ecosystems is crucial for understanding regional species turnover and effects of climate change on these systems. The temperate mountain forests in the Andean region of South America are among the largest and contiguous natural deciduous forest areas in the world. Due to their pronounced disturbance regime and different successional stages, a climatic zonation combined with the characterisation of its microclimatic variation is important to identify thresholds of species occurrences.We used micro-loggers to measure air temperature and relative humidity for one year at 40 measurement locations along longitudinal and elevation gradients in mountain forests in Northern Patagonia, Argentina. Our results unveil mesoclimatic patterns within these forests characterised by variations in temperature and vapour pressure deficit along the elevational gradient in general, but also at different times of the year. For example, Austrocedrus chilensis and Nothofagus dombeyi forests differed mainly by temperature and its diurnal range in the warmest months of the year. Also, differences between forest stands and gaps were more pronounced in the warmest months of the year and at lower elevations, with up to 2.5 K higher temperatures in the second half of the day in gaps. We found clear indications that shrubland of Nothofagus antarctica representing a successional stage after disturbances alters the mesoclimatic pattern, favouring forest fire ignition. Such mesoclimatic variations have a major influence on tree species turnover and ecological processes within these forest ecosystems.The findings contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between topography, climate, and vegetation in shaping the spatial patterns of species occurrences.",

        "Abstract": "The growing expansion of eucalyptus plantations in Brazil and the impact of exotic pests, such as Gonipterus platensis, demand effective, and sustainable biological control strategies. The aim of this study was to assess the pathogenicity of 10 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolates to neonate Gonipterus platensis larvae, commonly known as the eucalyptus weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) with the specific focus of evaluating their potential to manage this pest while preserving its egg parasitoid, Anaphes nitens. To achieve this, the genomic DNA of the 10 Bt isolates was extracted using the thermal lysis method for molecular characterization of their Cry and Vip proteins. Neonate G. platensis larvae were subjected to bioassays with each isolate, at a concentration of 1 × 109 spores/ml, was applied on 10 larvae per replication (3 replications). The concentration and lethal time to kill 50% of the larvae were determined for the most effective isolates. The Bt isolates 107 and 178 isolates even at concentrations 10× lower than those recommended for commercial Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis (Btt) formulations against Coleoptera pests, achieved 100% mortality of G. platensis larvae. These isolates, with coleopteran-specific genes, caused high mortality of neonate Gonipterus platensis larvae. This indicates their potential for the biological control of this pest and maybe of other Coleoptera pests. Their use poses minimal risk to non-target organisms such as the egg parasitoid A. nitens and indicates a promising avenue for integrated pest management strategies with effective pest control while preserving the ecological balance.",

        "Abstract": "The forest industry produces several low-value by-products, such as bark, sawdust, limbs, and leaves, that are not ultimately disposed of and remain in the forests and sawmill facilities. Among these by-products are leaves, which contain not only cellulose fibers and lignin but also essential oils such as terpenes. These are biosynthesized in a similar way as cis-1,4-polyisoprene. In this context, this work evaluates the use of screened and unscreened dried Eucalyptus nitens leaves in natural rubber. Among the most relevant results of this work is a significant increase in mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and elongation at break, reaching values of 9.45 MPa and 649% of tensile strength and elongation at break, respectively, for a sample of natural rubber containing sieved dried leaves of Eucalyptus nitens. In addition, it is observed that the content of this vegetable filler allows for inhibiting the antibacterial effect of vulcanized rubber against several bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli K 12, Escherichia coli FT 17 and Pseudomonas fluorescens. These results are promising because they not only add value to a by-product of the forestry industry, improving the mechanical properties of natural rubber from a sustainable approach but also increase the affinity of rubber with bacterial microorganisms that may play a role in certain ecosystems.",

        "Abstract": "Plant survival in a warmer world requires the timely adjustment of biological processes to cyclical changes in the new environment. Circadian oscillators have been proposed to contribute to thermal adaptation and plasticity. However, the influence of temperature on circadian clock performance and its impact on plant behaviour in natural ecosystems are not well-understood. We combined bioinformatics, molecular biology and ecophysiology to investigate the effects of increasing temperatures on the functioning of the circadian clock in two closely related tree species from Patagonian forests that constitute examples of adaptation to different thermal environments based on their altitudinal profiles. Nothofagus pumilio, the species from colder environments, showed a major rearrangement of its transcriptome and reduced ability to maintain rhythmicity at high temperatures compared with Nothofagus obliqua, which inhabits warmer zones. In altitude-swap experiments, N. pumilio, but not N. obliqua, showed limited oscillator function in warmer zones of the forest, and reduced survival and growth. Our findings show that interspecific differences in the influence of temperature on circadian clock performance are associated with preferred thermal niches, and to thermal plasticity of seedlings in natural environments, highlighting the potential role of a resonating oscillator in ecological adaptation to a warming environment.",

        "Abstract": "Color and morphology are some of the most intriguing traits of plant galls, whose patterns resemble fruits and flowers. Many hypotheses were proposed to explain the involvement of anthocyanin accumulation with the development of red gall hues, whose mechanisms seem idiosyncratic. Anthocyanins are related to photoprotective strategies in green tissues and metal accumulation in some flowers. Despite that, the combination of such physiological phenomena has been neglected for galls, which are photosynthetic neoplasms genetically similar to reproductive organs. Here, we integrated different perspectives by measuring photosynthetic pigment and anthocyanin concentration combined with fluorescence quenching analysis, antioxidant activity assays, and histochemical elemental mapping in red and green galls induced by Espinosa nothofagi (Hymenoptera) on Nothofagus obliqua (Nothofagaceae). We found no relationship between high anthocyanin concentrations, light exposure, and red coloration in galls as anthocyanin concentrations were higher in the outermost tissues of green galls than in red galls. Red galls presented higher concentrations of total chlorophyll and lower carotenoid concentrations than green galls and leaves, which correlated with their highest photosynthetic activity and iron accumulation. The red color coincides with the accumulation of aluminum and Fe<sup>3+</sup> and the lowest antioxidant capacity in the gall outer tissue. The high antioxidant capacity of N. obliqua galls and the Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> distribution are related to high photosynthesis, Fe-use efficiency in galls, and the supply of Fe to the inducer diet. Overall, iron metabolism connects the high photosynthesis activity to the red gall color in the presence of low anthocyanin concentrations, like some flowers.",

        "Abstract": "Pine wood nematodes (<i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, PWNs) are a major threat to <i>Pinus koraiensis</i> in northeast China, and emamectin benzoate (EB) is commonly used for their control. Although high doses of EB can alleviate symptoms of pine wilt disease (PWD), they do not fully eradicate PWNs due to their detoxification mechanisms. This study investigates the content of EB in <i>P. koraiensis</i> and its efficacy in controlling PWNs after exogenous application of EB. We found that while EB significantly reduced PWN populations, it did not eliminate them. Transcriptomic analysis of PWNs treated with concentration at 20% (LC<sub>20</sub>) revealed that PWNs exhibit detoxification responses to low EB concentrations (LC<sub>20</sub>), driven by the <i>Bx-SDR3</i> gene. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of this gene decreased the detoxification ability of PWNs and enhanced the toxic effects of LC<sub>20</sub> EB by 20.9%. These results highlight the key role of <i>Bx-SDR3</i> in PWN detoxification and suggest that targeting this gene could improve the effectiveness of EB, offering a promising strategy for more efficient and eco-friendly pest management.",

Its cultivation is carried out in forests and plantations, with intensive management techniques being studied to stimulate diameter growth, which is positively related to cone production.To evaluate the effect of fertilization in a 30-year-old plantation and to understand if adult trees respond to nutritional management.A trial with completely randomized block design was established with two treatments (fertilization/control) and three repetitions. The plantation, with a density of 204 trees/ha, is located in central Chile, on a sandy-loam soil with neutral pH, medium organic matter content, and a fertility condition that limits tree development. Fertilization considered the repeated application of macro (N, P, K, S, Mg) and micronutrients (B, Fe, and Zn). Periodic measurements of height, stem and crown diameter, and cone production were made up to age 36. Cone production was evaluated using mixed generalized linear models and growth variables using ANOVA (analysis of variance).Significant effects of fertilization on DBH annual growth (35% higher than the control, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and in cone production (3 times higher, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) were found.Fertilization is a useful practice to improve the growth and cone productivity of the species.",

        "Abstract": "Members of the <i>Pinus</i> genus are well known for their medicinal properties, which can be attributed to their essential oils. In this work, we have examined the leaf essential oils of five understudied <i>Pinus</i> species collected from various locations in western North America. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatographic methods, including enantioselective gas chromatography. <i>Pinus albicaulis</i> was dominated by (+)-δ-3-carene; <i>Pinus flexilis</i> was dominated by α-pinene (mostly (+)-α-pinene) and (-)-β-pinene; <i>Pinus lambertiana</i> was dominated by (-)-β-pinene; <i>Pinus monticola</i> was dominated by (-)-β-pinene, (+)-δ-3-carene, and (-)-α-pinene; and <i>Pinus sabiniana</i> was rich in (-)-α-pinene and limonene. While this work adds to our knowledge of <i>Pinus</i> essential oils, additional research is needed to more fully appreciate the geographic and altitudinal variations in the volatile compositions of these <i>Pinus</i> species.",

        "Abstract": "Fire is a major cause of tree injury and mortality worldwide, yet our current understanding of fire effects is largely based on ocular estimates of stem charring and foliage discoloration, which are error prone and provide little information on underlying tree function. Accurate quantification of physiological performance is a research and forest management need, given that declining performance could help identify mechanisms of-and serve as an early warning sign for-mortality. Many previous efforts have been hampered by the inability to quantify the heat flux that a tree experiences during a fire, given its highly variable nature in space and time. In this study, we used a dose-response approach to elucidate fire impacts by subjecting Pinus monticola var. minima Lemmon and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. glauca (Beissn.) Franco saplings to surface fires of varying intensity doses and measuring short-term post-fire physiological performance in photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence. We also evaluated the ability of spectral reflectance indices to quantify change in physiological performance at the individual tree crown and stand scales. Although physiological performance in both P. monticola and P. menziesii declined with increasing fire intensity, P. monticola maintained a greater photosynthetic rate and higher chlorophyll fluorescence at higher doses, for longer after the fire. Pinus monticola also had complete survival at lower fire intensity doses, whereas P. menziesii had some mortality at all doses, implying higher fire resistance for P. monticola at this life stage. Generally, individual-scale spectral indices were more accurate at quantifying physiological performance than those acquired at the stand-scale. The Photochemical Reflectance Index outperformed other indices at quantifying photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence, highlighting its potential use to quantify crown scale physiological performance. Spectral indices that incorporated near-infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance, such as the Normalized Burn Ratio, were accurate at characterizing stand-scale mortality. The results from this study were included in a conifer cross-comparison using physiology and mortality data from other dose-response studies. The comparison highlights the close evolutionary relationship between fire and species within the Pinus genus, assessed to date, given the high survivorship of Pinus species at lower fire intensities versus other conifers.",

Tolerance mechanisms could imply the cell wall as it is the first barrier before entry into the plant cell. Douglas-fir plantlets were grown <i>in vitro</i> on media supplemented with different aluminum chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) concentrations up to 1 mM. The characterization of the cell wall revealed quantitative and qualitative modifications in the polysaccharidic composition of the wall, in particular in roots whose pectins showed a higher galacturonic acid content with less ramification and a lower degree of methylesterification (DME) explained by a higher pectin methylesterase activity; these Al-induced changes suggest an Al-trapping process in cell wall structures. In stems and needles, the observed increase in DME rather suggests an exclusion of Al from the cell wall.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Pseudotsuga sinensis</i> is a distinctive plant species endemic to China, predominantly found in areas affected by varying degrees of rocky desertification. Despite its wide distribution, the physiological mechanisms underlying its adaptation to harsh environments remain unclear. In this study, we investigated 16 leaf traits, including the morphological, anatomical, and chemical characteristics of the leaves of <i>P. sinensis</i> across forests with mild, moderate, severe, and extremely severe rocky desertification to elucidate the adaptive strategies of <i>P. sinensis</i> in response to arid conditions and nutrient-poor soils. Our findings revealed that <i>P. sinensis</i> leaves from forests with mild and moderate rocky desertification exhibited higher specific leaf area (SLA) and magnesium concentrations but lower leaf dry matter content (LDMC), abaxial epidermis thickness, and adaxial epidermis thickness than in those from forests with severe and extremely severe desertification. Principal component analysis indicated that forests with mild to moderate desertification employ resource acquisition strategies characterized by greater SLA and magnesium concentrations than those in forests with severe and extremely severe desertification. In contrast, forests with severe to extremely severe desertification adopted resource-conserving strategies, as evidenced by higher LDMC, epidermal thickness, and calcium concentrations than those in forests with mild to moderate desertification. The N:P ratio of <i>P. sinensis</i> across all desertification levels was consistently below 14, suggesting nitrogen limitation in <i>P. sinensis</i> in regions with rocky desertification. Thus, these results provide valuable reference for guiding vegetation restoration under degraded habitats.",

        "Abstract": "Pine wood nematodes (<i>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</i>, PWNs) are a major threat to <i>Pinus koraiensis</i> in northeast China, and emamectin benzoate (EB) is commonly used for their control. Although high doses of EB can alleviate symptoms of pine wilt disease (PWD), they do not fully eradicate PWNs due to their detoxification mechanisms. This study investigates the content of EB in <i>P. koraiensis</i> and its efficacy in controlling PWNs after exogenous application of EB. We found that while EB significantly reduced PWN populations, it did not eliminate them. Transcriptomic analysis of PWNs treated with concentration at 20% (LC<sub>20</sub>) revealed that PWNs exhibit detoxification responses to low EB concentrations (LC<sub>20</sub>), driven by the <i>Bx-SDR3</i> gene. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of this gene decreased the detoxification ability of PWNs and enhanced the toxic effects of LC<sub>20</sub> EB by 20.9%. These results highlight the key role of <i>Bx-SDR3</i> in PWN detoxification and suggest that targeting this gene could improve the effectiveness of EB, offering a promising strategy for more efficient and eco-friendly pest management.",

Its cultivation is carried out in forests and plantations, with intensive management techniques being studied to stimulate diameter growth, which is positively related to cone production.To evaluate the effect of fertilization in a 30-year-old plantation and to understand if adult trees respond to nutritional management.A trial with completely randomized block design was established with two treatments (fertilization/control) and three repetitions. The plantation, with a density of 204 trees/ha, is located in central Chile, on a sandy-loam soil with neutral pH, medium organic matter content, and a fertility condition that limits tree development. Fertilization considered the repeated application of macro (N, P, K, S, Mg) and micronutrients (B, Fe, and Zn). Periodic measurements of height, stem and crown diameter, and cone production were made up to age 36. Cone production was evaluated using mixed generalized linear models and growth variables using ANOVA (analysis of variance).Significant effects of fertilization on DBH annual growth (35% higher than the control, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and in cone production (3 times higher, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) were found.Fertilization is a useful practice to improve the growth and cone productivity of the species.",

        "Abstract": "Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) play a crucial role in facilitating plant nutrient uptake from the soil although inorganic nitrogen (N) can potentially diminish this role. However, the effect of inorganic N availability and organic matter on shaping EMF-mediated plant iron (Fe) uptake remains unclear. To explore this, we performed a microcosm study on Pinus taeda roots inoculated with Suillus cothurnatus treated with +/-Fe-coated sand, +/-organic matter, and a gradient of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> concentrations. Mycorrhiza formation was most favorable under conditions with organic matter, without inorganic N. Synchrotron X-ray microfluorescence imaging on ectomycorrhizal cross-sections suggested that the effect of inorganic N on mycorrhizal Fe acquisition largely depended on organic matter supply. With organic matter, mycorrhizal Fe concentration was significantly decreased as inorganic N levels increased. Conversely, an opposite trend was observed when organic matter was absent. Spatial distribution analysis showed that Fe, zinc, calcium, and copper predominantly accumulated in the fungal mantle across all conditions, highlighting the mantle's critical role in nutrient accumulation and regulation of nutrient transfer to internal compartments. Our work illustrated that the liberation of soil mineral Fe and the EMF-mediated plant Fe acquisition are jointly regulated by inorganic N and organic matter in the soil.",

        "Abstract": "This study highlights the use of loblolly pine derived biochar for the removal of harmful algal bloom toxin, Saxitoxin (STX), from water. Biochar samples were prepared at varying pyrolysis temperatures (400, 600 and 800 °C) for 60 min. As pyrolysis temperature increases, enhancement in surface porosity was observed (S<sub>BET</sub> = 7.26 ± 0.2 m<sup>2</sup>/g to 408.15 ± 6.19 m<sup>2</sup>/g) while a decline in oxygen-containing functional groups was observed (1517.80 ± 14.98 μmol/g to 823.01 ± 7.72 μmol/g). This study aimed to discover the effects of adsorption parameters such as biochar dosage amount, contact time, initial concentration and initial pH on Saxitoxin adsorption. These studies revealed impressive results with >90 % toxin removal with dosage rate of 0.01 g/L, contact time of 30 min, and increasing percent removal with increasing initial STX concentration and initial pH in water. Maximum uptake was calculated for P400 with adsorption capacity of 314.37 μg/g. This showed that surface functionality showed higher affinity for STX uptake, which may be possible due to hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, ion-exchange, and π-π interactions. Applied kinetic models indicated both physisorption and chemisorption interactions with best fit supporting the Elovich models. Complementary, adsorption isotherm analysis confirmed the multilayer adsorption behavior of the Freundlich model. Therefore, these findings support the viable use of biochar material for the remediation of STX waters.",

        "Abstract": "<i>Pinus heldreichii</i> Christ. (Bosnian pine), a Tertiary relict and Balkan sub-endemic, has not been comprehensively studied for its essential oil (EO) profile and bioactivity of its different plant parts. This study aimed to determine the EO yield, composition and antimicrobial activity from different parts of <i>P. heldreichii</i> at three different populations (mountains) in Bulgaria. Furthermore, the study assessed the antioxidant activities of plant tissue, including leaves (needles), twigs wood, male and female cones. The EOs yield from different plant parts ranged from 0.09 % (leaves) to 0.74 % (wood of twigs), with monoterpenes being the predominant class. Limonene, <i>α</i>-pinene, <i>β-</i>caryophyllene, germacrene D, <i>β-</i>pinene, and <i>β</i>-myrcene were detected in the EO extracted from all analyzed trees. However, these compounds were not found in the EO extracted from all plant parts of the same trees. Four chemical groups (chemotypes) were identified for EO from twigs, and three chemotypes were identified for EO from leaves. The chemotypes were based on the percent ratio of the main EO constituents (>5 %). Leaves tissue showed the highest values in terms of polyphenols and flavonoids, as well as higher ABTS radical scavenging activity, while the highest antimicrobial activity against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> subsp. <i>aureus</i> was seen in the EOs obtained from twigs. This is the first study to identify several chemotypes based on leaf and twigs EO of <i>P. heldreichii</i> distributed in Bulgarian flora. Furthermore, the EO of twigs tips (TT), male cones (MC), and wood of one-two-year-old twigs (WT) of the same trees were reported for the first time. The total polyphenol, flavonoid content, and radical scavenging activity of tissues of annual twigs wood and biennial twigs wood, leaf tissue, MC tissue, and the twigs tips tissue is also reported for the first time in the accessible literature. These findings highlight the potential of <i>P. heldreichii</i> to provide EOs with varying compositions and bioactivities, making them suitable for nutraceutical, pharmacological, and potentially food additive applications. Furthermore, the identification of chemotype accessions in this study suggests their selection for the development of new forest crop as a source for natural products with desirable composition and bioactivity.",

        "Abstract": "We investigated the dendroclimatic response of a Pinus heldreichii metapopulation distributed over a wide elevation interval (from 882 to 2143 m a.s.l.), spanning from low mountain to upper subalpine vegetation belts in the southern Italian Apennines. The tested hypothesis is that wood growth along an elevational gradient is non-linearly related to air temperature. During three years of fieldwork (2012-2015) at 24 sites, we collected wood cores from a total of 214 pine trees with diameter at breast height from 19 to 180 cm (average 82.7 ± 32.9 cm). We used a combination of tree-ring and genetic methods to reveal factors involved in growth acclimation using a space-for-time approach. Scores from canonical correspondence analysis were used to combine individual tree-ring series into four composite chronologies related to air temperature along the elevation gradient. Overall, the June dendroclimatic response followed a bell-shaped thermal niche curve, increasing until a peak around 13-14 °C. A similarly bell-shaped response was found with previous autumn air temperature, and both dendroclimatic signals interacted with stem size and growth rates, generating a divergent growth response between the top and the bottom of the elevation gradient. Increased tree growth in the upper subalpine belt was consistent with the consequences of increasing air temperature under no drought stress. A positive link was uncovered between pine growth at all elevations and April mean temperature, with trees growing at the lowest elevations showing the strongest growth response. No elevational genetic differences were found, hence long-lived tree species with small geographical ranges may reverse their climatic response between the lower and upper bioclimatic zones of their environmental niche. Our study revealed a high resistance and acclimation capability of Mediterranean forest stands, and such low vulnerability to changing climatic conditions highlights the potential to store carbon in these ecosystems for the coming decades.",

        "Abstract": "This investigation aimed to assess the in vitro and in silico biological properties of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract obtained from leaves of <i>Rubus ulmifolius</i> Schott collected in Algeria. The phytochemical screening data disclosed that flavonoids, tannins, coumarins, saponins, and anthocyanins were abundant. High levels of total phenolics, total flavonoids and flavonols (523.25 ± 3.53 µg GAE/mg, 20.41 ± 1.80, and 9.62 ± 0.51 µg QE/mg respectively) were detected. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis was performed to identify low molecular weight compounds. d-(-)-Fructofuranose, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and catechin were detected as main metabolites of the EtOAc extract. The outcomes revealed that the extract exerted a potent antioxidant apt, and ensured significant bacterial growth inhibitory capacity, where the inhibition zone diameters ranged from 20.0 ± 0.5 to 24.5 ± 0.3 mm. These outcomes were confirmed through molecular docking against key bacterial enzymes that revealed significant interactions and binding affinities. d-(-)-Fructofuranose was identified as the most polar and flexible compound. Gallic acid and caffeic acid demonstrated higher unsaturation. Caffeic acid was well absorbed in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and human intestine. Catechin was well absorbed in CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and can act as an inhibitor of CYP1A2. These results highlight how crucial it is to keep looking into natural substances in the quest for more potent and targeted pathology therapies.",

        "Abstract": "Macroplastic litter causes detrimental effects on freshwater biota affecting human health. Despite the significant role of rivers in transporting plastic waste, most plastics remain in fluvial ecosystems, accumulating in infrastructure, river sediment, and (riverbank) vegetated areas. However, the entrapment of plastics by riparian vegetation was overlooked, particularly in upper and middle river courses. For the first time, we aimed to quantify the entrapment of plastics by riparian vegetation along the entire river course. Sampling riparian areas in the upper, middle, and lower river courses in central Italy, we found 1548 macrolitter items, with vegetation entrapping 93.9% of total litter. Riverbank and riparian plastics acted as long-term indicators of river plastics. We emphasized the trapping efficiency at the species level highlighting that the best plastic trapper species were trees, shrubs and reeds (Populus spp., Salix spp., Rubus ulmifolius, Phragmites australis, and Ficus carica), blocking 85.4% of the total macrolitter entrapped by plants. Plastic pieces, bags, bandages, sanitary items, and packaging were among the most trapped types. Furthermore, vegetation in the lower river course exhibited greater plastic entrapment compared to the upper and middle courses, following the fact that all the river courses contribute to plastic pollution. Recognizing the potential of riparian vegetation as a valuable ecosystem service in trapping macroplastics, further research should explore the characteristics and structures of riparian communities involved in this process. By developing eco-safe practices and mitigation strategies based on these findings, we might contribute significantly to managing, conserving, and restoring riverine ecosystems.",

Pannonia) and two white willow clones (<i>Salix alba</i> cl. 380, cl. 107/65-9) were tested in pot trials. The aim was to evaluate their potential for phytoextraction of nine heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in three substrates, two based on soil from landfills near Belgrade and Novi Sad, and one control treatment based on nursery soil. The shoot content of all analyzed heavy metals was the highest in the BG substrate with the highest content of heavy metals and the lowest in the control substrate. White willow clone 107/65-9 achieved the highest accumulation of Cd, Cr, Fe, Ni and Pb and along with another willow clone 380 is found to act as generalists. Poplar clones performed more as specialists: I-214 and Pannonia for copper, PE 19/66 for manganese and S1-8 for nickel and zinc. Considerable differences among examined clones in heavy metal accumulation and reaction to substrates should be taken into consideration in further pot and field trials as well as in phytoremediation projects on landfills.",

In this study, we tested the prediction that relative losses of foliage to defoliating insects increase with leaf damage diversity (LDD), and we also explored the mechanisms underlying the observed LDD patterns. We measured insect herbivory in 501 individuals of three deciduous woody species (<i>Betula pubescens</i>, <i>Salix phylicifolia</i>, and <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i>) across 38 localities in north-western Russia, collected 8844 leaves damaged by defoliating insects, classifying the 21,073 feeding events observed in these leaves into 29 damage types. Overall, LDD significantly decreased with increasing latitude but showed no variation along elevation or pollution gradients. Herbivory weakly but significantly increased with increasing LDD, and a strong positive correlation between the rarefied number of leaf damage types and their evenness provided evidence for the complementarity effect underlying this herbivory increase, indicating that insects producing different leaf damage types differ in their resource use.",

        "Title": "Unravelling the Relationship Between Height, Lean Mass, Alzheimer's Disease and Cognition Through Mendelian Randomization.",
        "Abstract": "Genetic evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses suggests that higher lean mass causally protects against Alzheimer's disease (AD) and enhances cognitive function. However, the potential confounding role of height, which shares genetic etiology with lean mass, has not been fully examined.Genetic predictors of whole-body lean mass were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed in the UK Biobank cohort (UKB; <i>n</i> = 448,322). Genetic predictors of height were also obtained from UKB (height<sub>0.5M</sub> = 455,332) and from a GWAS meta-analysis (height<sub>1.5M</sub><i>n</i> = 1,578,425). The study outcomes included clinically diagnosed AD (21,982 cases and 41,944 controls) and cognitive performance (<i>n</i> = 269,867). All study participants were of European ancestry. We conducted univariable and multivariable MR analyses to examine the total and independent effects of lean mass and height on the specified outcomes under different statistical adjustment strategies.In univariable MR analyses, genetically proxied lean mass (odds ratio [OR] per 1-standard deviation [SD] increase 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-0.91, <i>p</i> = 3.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup>) and height (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.84-0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.001) were associated with reduced risk of AD. Genetically proxied lean mass (β 0.10, 95% CI 0.08-0.12, <i>p</i> = 6.24 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and height (β 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.08, <i>p</i> = 1.16 × 10<sup>-15</sup>) were further associated with improved cognitive performance. In multivariable MR analyses, adjustment for height<sub>1.5M</sub> partially attenuated the lean mass association with AD (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74-1.12, <i>p</i> = 0.40), whereas the height<sub>1.5M</sub>-AD association remained similar after adjusting for lean mass (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, <i>p</i> = 0.04). Adjustment for height also attenuated the association of lean mass with cognitive performance (β 0.00, 95% CI -0.07-0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.94), whereas height maintained a similar association with improved cognitive performance after adjustment for lean mass (β 0.07, 95% CI 0.03-0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.001).Height may confound the genetic associations between lean mass and both cognitive performance and AD risk. Residual direct effects of lean mass on AD risk cannot be excluded due to limitations in statistical power and genetic instrument strength in MVMR. These findings emphasize the necessity of adjusting for height when using MR to investigate the clinical effects of lean mass.",

        "Abstract": "Anxiety is the most common and widespread mental health disorder impacting youth between the ages of 10-19. Youth of color including Hispanic youth are disproportionately impacted. Fewer than 20% of youth of color who need mental health services are receiving them. However, we know relatively little about how to best engage Hispanic youth to increase their use of mental health services. The aims of this study were to better understand the personal, environmental, and behavioral factors that impact Hispanic adolescents help-seeking behaviors and to identify the important criteria needed to develop an appealing intervention that would increase engagement with mental health services. This study used a Design Thinking process-a participatory research approach that included qualitative and engaged methods. In-depth interviews (n = 8) and a Design Thinking workshop (n = 11 participants) were conducted with Hispanic youth with anxiety residing in the San Francisco Bay Area. In-depth interviews were coded using Social Cognitive Theory to identify key themes that impact an adolescent's decision to seek help. The 90-minute workshop included ideation and Design Thinking activities including personas, mind-mapping, and analytical problem-solving to identify the most important tools and strategies that could be used to manage anxiety. The study identified several themes that directly impact program design, including barriers to seeking help for anxiety, coping strategies, sources of support, and specific program ideas. The findings revealed that Hispanic youth want a culturally relevant technology-based program that provides easily accessible educational information and coping strategies delivered in an engaging format that also facilitates mental health support with a trusted adult. The results reinforce the need to develop culturally inclusive and innovative programs designed specifically for priority populations to increase youth engagement with mental health services.",

        "Abstract": "The plant kingdom serves as a valuable resource for cancer drug development. This study explored the antitumor activity of different sub-fractions (hexane, dichloromethane and methanol) of <i>U. gallii</i> (gorse) methanol extract in glioblastoma (U-87MG and U-373MG) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell lines, along with their phytochemical profiles. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, and cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were assessed through flow cytometry and by measuring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein expression levels. D7 and D8 dichloromethane sub-fractions significantly reduced cell viability, triggered early apoptosis in SH-SY5Y and U-87MG cells and specifically increased ROS levels in U-87MG cells. Western blot analyses showed that D7 increased p53, caspase-3, caspase-8 and γH2AX expression in SH-SY5Y and U-87MG cells, while D8 specifically elevated p53 in SH-SY5Y cells and caspase-3 in both cell lines. In U-373 cells, D7 and D8 markedly reduced cell viability, with D8 inducing necrosis. Morphological changes indicative of apoptosis were also observed in all cell lines. Bioinformatic analysis of UHPLC-MS and GC-MS data tentatively identified 20 metabolites in D7 and 15 in D8, primarily flavonoids. HPLC-DAD confirmed isoprunetin and genistein as the most abundant in D7 and D8, respectively, both isolated and identified by NMR spectroscopy. Most of the flavonoids identified have been reported as antitumor agents, suggesting that these compounds may be responsible for the observed pharmacological activity.",

        "Abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are connective tissue autoimmune diseases. The present study aimed to check whether serum clusterin (CLU) concentration and its glycosylation pattern may be markers differentiating these diseases-blood sera of patients with PsA (n = 37), RA (n = 34), and healthy subjects (control, n = 21) were examined. CLU concentration was measured using the ELISA test. Glycosylation was analyzed using lectin-ELISA with sialo-specific lectins from <i>Maackia amurensis</i> (MAA) and <i>Sambucus nigra</i> (SNA) recognizing sialic acid (SA) α2,3- and α2,6-linked, respectively, and fucose-specific lectins from <i>Lotus tetragonolobus</i> (LTA), <i>Ulex europaeus</i> (UEA), and <i>Lens culinaris</i> (LCA) specific to fucose α1,3-linked, α1,2-linked, and core fucose, respectively. Significantly higher CLU concentrations were observed in the PsA than in the RA patients. The expression of α2,6-linked SA was significantly higher in the PsA and RA patients than in the control. The expression of SNA-reactive SA was visibly higher in the PsA compared to the RA and control group but insignificant. Negative significant correlations between CLU concentrations and its glycans reactivity with LTA and UEA were also observed. Significantly higher serum CLU concentration, accompanied by a high expression of SNA-reactive SA and a reduced degree of Lewis<sup>x</sup> and Lewis<sup>y</sup> antennary fucosylation, may constitute a promising panel of parameters differentiating PsA from RA.",
